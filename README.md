Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deploying 

I was unable to deploy this app from my github repo using Netlify and other similar websites. 
But i found a work around using the netlify-cli and now it works fine. Earlier i was getting invalid API KEY errors in the browser console (status code - 401).
